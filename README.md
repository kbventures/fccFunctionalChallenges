Free Code Camp Functional Programming Challenges

# Functional programming follows a few core principles:

Functions are independent from the state of the program or global variables. They only depend on the arguments passed into them to make a calculation
Functions try to limit any changes to the state of the program and avoid changes to the global objects holding data
Functions have minimal side effects in the program

# Functional programming is about:

Isolated functions - there is no dependence on the state of the program, which includes global variables that are subject to change

Pure functions - the same input always gives the same output

Functions with limited side effects - any changes, or mutations, to the state of the program outside the function are carefully controlled
